These skills encompass both receptive skills, which involve understanding and processing language input, and productive skills, which involve producing language output. Language skills are essential for communication in various contexts, such as social interactions, education, work, and everyday life. The four main language skills are:

1) Listening: Listening is the ability to understand spoken language. It involves actively receiving and processing auditory information, such as spoken words, sounds, and intonation, and making meaning from it. Listening skills include understanding main ideas, details, and nuances, as well as interpreting tone, mood, and emotions conveyed through spoken language.

2) Speaking: Speaking is the ability to express oneself verbally in a language. It involves using appropriate vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and intonation to convey ideas, opinions, feelings, and information to others. Speaking skills include initiating and maintaining conversations, giving presentations, participating in discussions, and using social language in various situations.

3) Reading: Reading is the ability to understand written language. It involves decoding and interpreting written words, sentences, and texts, and making meaning from them. Reading skills include understanding main ideas, details, inferences, and text structures, as well as interpreting tone, mood, and style conveyed through written language.

4) Writing: Writing is the ability to produce written language.

Reading skills are the abilities and strategies that individuals use to effectively understand and interpret written texts. Reading skills involve a complex process of decoding, comprehending, and critically evaluating written language in order to extract meaning and make sense of the information presented. Reading skills are crucial for academic success, professional development, and everyday life, as reading is an essential tool for gaining knowledge, accessing information, and engaging with written texts across various domains. Here are some key reading skills:

1) Decoding: Decoding is the ability to recognize and decipher written words and sentences. It involves applying knowledge of letter-sound relationships, sight words, and word recognition strategies to read words accurately and fluently. Decoding skills are fundamental to reading as they enable the reader to access the meaning of written language.

2) Vocabulary: Vocabulary is the knowledge of words and their meanings. Building a robust vocabulary is crucial for effective reading as it allows the reader to comprehend the meaning of words encountered in texts. Vocabulary skills involve recognizing and understanding the meaning of words in context, using context clues, and learning new words through various strategies such as word analysis, inference, and word learning techniques.

3) Comprehension: Comprehension is the ability to understand and make meaning from written texts. It involves actively engaging with the text, applying prior knowledge, and using reading strategies such as predicting, questioning, summarizing, and visualizing to understand the meaning of the text. Comprehension skills also involve understanding text structure, identifying main ideas, details, and supporting evidence, and making inferences and connections between ideas in the text.

4) Critical Thinking: Critical thinking skills are essential for effective reading as they involve evaluating, analyzing, and interpreting the content and meaning of texts. Critical thinking skills include evaluating the reliability, credibility, and bias of sources, analyzing arguments and evidence presented in the text, and evaluating the author's purpose, tone, and perspective. Critical thinking skills also involve forming opinions, making judgments, and synthesizing information from different sources.

5) Reading Rate and Fluency: Reading rate and fluency refer to the speed and accuracy with which one reads. Skilled readers are able to read text fluently, which means reading with appropriate speed, accuracy, and prosody (expression and intonation). Reading rate and fluency are important as they affect overall comprehension and the ability to read and understand texts efficiently.

6) Metacognition: Metacognition refers to the awareness and control of one's own thinking processes. Skilled readers engage in metacognitive strategies, such as self-monitoring, self-questioning, and self-regulation, to actively monitor their comprehension, adjust their reading strategies, and make meaning from the text. Metacognition helps readers become more strategic, reflective, and independent in their reading.

Developing strong reading skills is a lifelong process that involves practice, exposure to a variety of texts, and active engagement with the reading process. Reading skills are essential for academic success, critical thinking, and effective communication, and they are fundamental for accessing and understanding information in various contexts.
