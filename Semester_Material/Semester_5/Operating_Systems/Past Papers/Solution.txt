Wait reduces value by 1 and signal increases the value by 1

Since X = 0 at the start, it is clear that P4 and P5 cannot execute first.

5 possible execution orders of the processes are:-

i) P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P5

Explanation:-

Initially, X =0 , Y=1, Z=1

After P1 executes :- X =0 , Y=1, Z=1

After P2 :- X =1 , Y=1, Z=0

After P3 :- X =1, Y=0, Z=1

After P4 :- X =0, Y = 1, Z=1

After P6 :- X=1, Y=1,Z=0

After P5 :- X=0,Y=1,Z=0

Thus, processes can execute in this order.

ii)  P1, P6, P3, P4, P2, P5

Explanation :- 

Initially, X =0 , Y=1, Z=1

After P1 executes :- X =0 , Y=1, Z=1

After P6 :- X =1 , Y=1, Z=0

After P3 :- X =1, Y=0, Z=1

After P4 :- X =0, Y = 1, Z=1

After P2 :- X=1, Y=1,Z=0

After P5 :- X=0,Y=1,Z=0

Thus, processes can execute in this order.

iii) P2, P3, P1, P4, P6, P5

Explanation:- 

Initially, X =0 , Y=1, Z=1

After P2 executes :- X =1 , Y=1, Z=0

After P3 :- X =1 , Y=0, Z=1

After P1 :- X =1, Y=0, Z=1

After P4 :- X =0, Y = 1, Z=1

After P6 :- X=1, Y=1,Z=0

After P5 :- X=0,Y=1,Z=0

Thus, processes can execute in this order.

iv) P6, P3, P1, P4, P2, P5

Explanation:- 

Initially, X =0 , Y=1, Z=1

After P6 executes :- X =1 , Y=1, Z=0

After P3 :- X =1 , Y=0, Z=1

After P1 :- X =1, Y=0, Z=1

After P4 :- X =0, Y = 1, Z=1

After P2 :- X=1, Y=1,Z=0

After P5 :- X=0,Y=1,Z=0

Thus, processes can execute in this order.

v) P6, P4, P3, P1, P2, P5

Explanation:- 

Initially, X =0 , Y=1, Z=1

After P6 executes :- X =1 , Y=1, Z=0

After P4 :- X =0 , Y=1, Z=0

After P3 :- X =0, Y=0, Z=1

After P1 :- X =0, Y = 0, Z=1

After P2 :- X=1, Y=0,Z=0

After P5 :- X=0,Y=1,Z=0

Thus, processes can execute in this order.
